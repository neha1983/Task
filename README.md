SUB: Request for Gratuity cheque deposit and cumulative PF withdrawal

Dear Ma'am,

I am hereby writing to formally request for my PF withdrawal. As my service in your esteemed institution had come to an end in August 2020, I request you to please release the cumulative Provident Fund entitlement due to myself as on date. 

Please find enclosed a cancelled cheque and 2 copies of the letter in duplicate, with my signatures as acknowledgement and returning back a copy to myself once received at your end. 

Regarding Gratuity, presently both my husband and I are not residing in Kolkata. Hence, unable to collect the cheque in person. Would request if you could please arrange for the same to be deposited in the same account as per the cancelled cheque I have enclosed for PF deposit. Will sincerely appreciate it.

As mentioned to you earlier, my health has still not entirely improved post hospitalization and I have been advised against travelling and extreme strain due to my fragile and ill health. 

Would request you to please consider my plea above on compassionate grounds and kindly help with facilitating both my earnest requests.

Thanking you, 


Poonam Arora

Enclosed: Cancelled cheque from ICICI Bank
